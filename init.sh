In the X project, I illustrated a social media campaign for a local clothes brand. The goal of the campaign was to improve their visibility and build an engaged audience within their target marketâ€™s age range. To achieve this goal, I implemented unique strategies such as targeted Facebook ads, promotional products for sale at local events. These strategies were extremely effective because they delivered results consistently over time - by the end of the month-long campaign, this local clothing brand became fully aware of its market and had increased sales by 15%.
